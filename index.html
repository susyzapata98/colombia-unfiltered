    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am from South America, Colombia, and I love my country deeply. My name is Susana Zapata, and I created this blog to change the mistaken perception that many people abroad still have about Colombia. I want to show the truth: the colours, the diversity, the resilience, and the transformation of a nation that is so much more than the shadow of Pablo Escobar. Welcome to a different Colombia.
