🇨🇴 **Colombia Unfiltered**  
*From myth to reality. A country beyond Escobar.*

Every time I say “I’m Colombian,” someone mentions Pablo Escobar or asks about cocaine.  
But Colombia is **not a Netflix narco series**.

It’s a story of resilience, of art, of coffee, of reinvented cities,  
of breathtaking landscapes and people who never give up.

It’s time to tell the truth: a country that has suffered, yes,  
but one that never stopped blooming.

🌟 Explore the blog and discover a Colombia that goes far beyond stereotypes.
