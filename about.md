Hi, I’m Susana Zapata, and this space is dedicated to showing what Colombia truly is.  
Beyond the stigma and sensationalism, I believe in telling real stories –  
of our people, our land, our struggles and hopes.

This blog was born from the desire to change the narrative.  
Thank you for being part of that journey. 💛💙❤️
