  <h1>Colombia Unfiltered: From Myth to Reality</h1>
  <p><em>From myth to reality. A country beyond Escobar.</em></p>

  <p>Every time the word ‚ÄúColombian‚Äù is spoken, echoes of Pablo Escobar or questions about cocaine are not far behind. Yet, Colombia is not a Netflix narco series. It is a story of resilience, of art, of coffee, of reinvented cities, of breathtaking landscapes and people who never give up.</p>

  <p>It is time to tell the truth: a nation that has suffered, but never stopped blooming.</p>

  <h2>1. Voices in the Storm: Colombia‚Äôs Political Reality Today</h2>
  <p>Colombia‚Äôs political landscape is far from perfect, but it is not the chaos that some portray either. Tensions and polarisation remain, yes, but so does an increasingly active and aware civil society.</p>
  <p>Young people are taking part, debates are stronger, and political scandals no longer go unnoticed. There is a growing demand for transparency and change. Although progress is slow, democracy is alive. Colombia has not yet arrived where it needs to be, but it is moving forward.</p>

  <h2>2. The Green Jewel of the Continent: Colombia‚Äôs Natural Beauty</h2>
  <p>Few countries boast what Colombia does: Amazon rainforest, two oceans, snow-capped Andean peaks, deserts, plains, and magical rivers like Ca√±o Cristales. Colombia is the second most biodiverse country in the world ‚Äî home to over 1,900 bird species, hundreds of unique butterflies, and plants found nowhere else.</p>
  <p>Every corner of the country hides a piece of paradise still waiting to be fully discovered.</p>

  <h2>3. Liquid Gold: Colombian Coffee Around the World</h2>
  <p>Behind every cup of Colombian coffee lies a story of heritage, tradition, and hard work. In the mountains of the Coffee Region, entire families proudly cultivate what is considered one of the finest coffees on Earth.</p>
  <p>Colombia is the world‚Äôs third-largest coffee exporter, but often ranked first in quality. It is more than a product ‚Äî it is part of the national identity. A symbol of warmth that carries Colombia‚Äôs name to tables in Japan, Australia, Europe, and beyond.</p>

  <h2>4. Five Cities, Five Reasons to Believe</h2>
  <h3>Bogot√° ‚Äì Monserrate and culture at the summit</h3>
  <p>The capital is not only the political centre ‚Äî it's also a cultural powerhouse. Monserrate, towering at over 3,000 metres, offers views that connect visitors with the city‚Äôs soul. With libraries, museums, street art, and one of the largest bike networks in Latin America, Bogot√° is vibrant, intellectual, and constantly evolving.</p>

  <h3>Medell√≠n ‚Äì The Metrocable and urban transformation</h3>
  <p>Once known for violence, Medell√≠n is now a global example of innovation. The Metrocable doesn‚Äôt just connect neighbourhoods ‚Äî it‚Äôs a symbol of inclusion and change. Medell√≠n breathes creativity, from its flower festivals to its public libraries and tech initiatives.</p>

  <h3>Cali ‚Äì Cristo Rey and the cradle of salsa</h3>
  <p>Overlooking the city, the Cristo Rey statue stands tall above a place that dances through life. Cali is joy, Afro-Colombian rhythm, and pride. Known as the world capital of salsa, it pulses with music, identity, and resilience.</p>

  <h3>Barranquilla ‚Äì Carnival and unfiltered joy</h3>
  <p>The Barranquilla Carnival isn‚Äôt just a celebration ‚Äî it‚Äôs a UNESCO heritage event. A burst of colour, culture and history, it embodies the spirit of the Caribbean. Today, Barranquilla also leads in industrial development and urban growth, showing the best of tradition and modernisation.</p>

  <h3>Bucaramanga ‚Äì Chicamocha Canyon, nature and progress</h3>
  <p>With one of the most stunning natural wonders in the country ‚Äî the Chicamocha Canyon ‚Äî Bucaramanga is also known for its green urban planning, innovation and high quality of life. A city on the rise, blending nature and progress with a calm yet ambitious pace.</p>

  <h2>5. From Shadows to Light: Colombia in the 90s vs Now</h2>
  <p>The 1990s were Colombia‚Äôs darkest days ‚Äî bombings, hitmen, kidnappings, cartels, and fear at every turn. The country was internationally seen as dangerous and unstable. But that is not the full story.</p>
  <p>Today, most Colombians grow up far removed from war. Universities are full, community projects are thriving, and street art tells stories of hope. The FARC disarmed, peace processes continue, and although challenges persist, people no longer hide ‚Äî they build. Colombia has moved from surviving to truly living.</p>
