Welcome to **Colombia Unfiltered** — a space to explore Colombia beyond the headlines.

This blog was born out of the need to challenge the stereotypes that have haunted our country for decades.  
Yes, our past has been complex — but we are so much more than that. Colombia is:

☕ A land of world-class coffee  
🌿 A country of breathtaking biodiversity  
🎨 A vibrant culture full of creativity and resilience  
🗳️ A democracy still evolving, with young voices rising

We invite you to read, share, and explore with us.  
Because Colombia deserves to be seen — clearly, truly, and unfiltered.
