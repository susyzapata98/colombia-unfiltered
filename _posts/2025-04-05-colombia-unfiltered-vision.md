**Colombia Unfiltered**  
*From myth to reality. A country beyond Escobar.*

Every time the word “Colombian” is spoken, echoes of Pablo Escobar or questions about cocaine are not far behind.  
Yet, Colombia is not a Netflix narco series. It is a story of resilience, of art, of coffee, of reinvented cities, of breathtaking landscapes and people who never give up.

It is time to tell the truth: a nation that has suffered, but never stopped blooming.

### 1. Voices in the Storm: Colombia’s Political Reality Today

Colombia’s political landscape is far from perfect, but it is not the chaos that some portray either.  
Tensions and polarisation remain, yes, but so does an increasingly active and aware civil society.

Young people are taking part, debates are stronger, and political scandals no longer go unnoticed.  
There is a growing demand for transparency and change. Although progress is slow, democracy is alive.  
Colombia has not yet arrived where it needs to be, but it is moving forward.

### 2. The Green Jewel of the Continent: Colombia’s Natural Beauty

Few countries boast what Colombia does: Amazon rainforest, two oceans, snow-capped Andean peaks, deserts, plains, and magical rivers like Caño Cristales.  
Colombia is the second most biodiverse country in the world — home to over 1,900 bird species, hundreds of unique butterflies, and plants found nowhere else.

Every corner of the country hides a piece of paradise still waiting to be fully discovered.

### 3. Liquid Gold: Colombian Coffee Around the World

Behind every cup of Colombian coffee lies a story of heritage, tradition, and hard work.  
In the mountains of the Coffee Region, entire families proudly cultivate what is considered one of the finest coffees on Earth.

Colombia is the world’s third-largest coffee exporter, but often ranked first in quality.  
It is more than a product — it is part of the national identity. A symbol of warmth that carries Colombia’s name to tables in Japan, Australia, Europe, and beyond.

### 5. From Shadows to Light: Colombia in the 90s vs Now

The 1990s were Colombia’s darkest days — bombings, hitmen, kidnappings, cartels, and fear at every turn.  
The country was internationally seen as dangerous and unstable. But that is not the full story.

Today, most Colombians grow up far removed from war.  
Universities are full, community projects are thriving, and street art tells stories of hope.  
The FARC disarmed, peace processes continue, and although challenges persist, people no longer hide — they build.

Colombia has moved from surviving to truly living.
